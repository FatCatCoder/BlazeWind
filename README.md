# 🌈 BlazeWind 🐋 🌬️
Blazor Tailwindcss library with auto-tooling


## FYI: WIP 

## The magic exists in the MSBuild tasks
- sets up complicated tailwindcsss tooling
- first build installs tailwindcss cli, init, build
- every build after runs build
- debug mode auto runs the tailwind watcher

## why?
An improvement on previous ways of using blazor and tailwindcss which felt too hacked together and too much time setup to be 
approachable for most people.
